# Regression Model to Predict the Outcome of a Football Match

The goal of this analysis is to come up with a model that can predict the results of a football game between two teams. Some of the considerations that will form the basis of the prediction model include the team that is home, the team that is playing away, whether or not the game is friendly among other considerations.

I used both polyniomial and logistic regression to come up with the best model.

# Project Description

Football is currently the most popular sport in the world. This is according to various sports ranking criteria such as global fan base and audience, viewership on t.v., popularity on the internet, sponsorship deals among other financial and social factors. Among football fans and even professional football analysts, predicting the outcome of a particular match is quite common.

There are several factors that affect the outcome of a football game. Some teams generally perform better than others as classified in the FIFA ranikings. These rankings rate national teams based on their performance on FIFA-recognized international matches.The ranking method has changed overtime since it's inception in 1993.

In general, it would be presumed that a high ranking team will be better suited to win a game against a low ranking opponent. However, there are other factors that could come into play. Some of these factors include, which team is playing at home versus away and whether or not the match is friendly. Using some of these factors, this analysis aims to take advantage of machine learning algorithms and develop a model that can predict the outcome of a football match. More specifically, I will be using a polynomial and logistic regression approach to come up with a suitable model.

I used two datasets for this project. The first dataset contains records of various football matches since 1872 to 2019. Other attributes available in this dataset include the home team, away team, goals scored by home team, goals by away team, location of match and the tournament type.The second dataset contains the annual FIFA ranking records since 1993 through 2018. Some of the attributes included in the second dataset include country name and code, country rank, date of ranking, previous and total points among other variables.
